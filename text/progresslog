sun: 12/11/16

-file upload with angular to folder
-understand request/response objects better
-added very basic upload page
Goals Tomorrow:
-finish file upload system a bit
-figure out file system and database a bit
-file types question (mp3? try to ask luis this)
-cookies, account system, database!
Notes:
It seems like the database system is central to this.
Understanding that will determine my success here.
A good database design will largely determine the possibilities of the site.
Also the backend/server is essential. Those things together will largely make the app run how it runs.
